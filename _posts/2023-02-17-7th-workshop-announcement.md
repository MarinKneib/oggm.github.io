### What is it ?

**The workshop is the 7<sup>th</sup> in a series that has brought together the community of users 
and developers of the Open Global Glacier Model ([OGGM](oggm.org)). This year's workshop 
is organized by colleagues based at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences). It is open to anybody interested in global glacier modeling with focus on active developers and users of OGGM. The primary goal is to discuss the challenges 
and solutions in modeling glaciers at large scales with OGGM, to learn from each other, and to develop 
ideas and visions for the advancement of the model. The workshop will include scientific 
presentations, hands-on coding sessions, discussion/brainstorming sessions, and generally 
be held in an informal manner (with a possible hike to a Scottish National park).**

### Agenda

The workshop will include:

1. <b>Scientific presentations</b> by the participants (ca. 15-20 min) on topics related to the theme of the workshop. 
These can include the state, recent developments and results of glacier modeling with OGGM.
2. <b>Discussion/brainstorming sessions</b> focused on topics of interest, such as future developments and visions for the model.
3. <b>Hands-on sessions</b> in smaller groups including:
   - Beginner tutorials: these sessions are for current and future OGGM users to learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
   - Advanced tutorials: on topics such as <i>How to contribute to OGGM</i>, <i>use OGGM with your own data</i>, or <i>use parts of OGGM with another model</i>.
   - Q&A session: on model problems and possible solutions.

4.  <b>Workshop excursion</b>: Ice sheets covered all of Scotland in the past, leaving an amazing landscape behind. We plan to have a one-day excursion to one of Scotland's iconic ice carved landscapes.

We would have the beginner hands-on sessions 
at the first 1.5 days of the workshop, so new users of OGGM can get up to speed and have a better understanding 
of what is coming next. For the rest of the week, (tentatively) we plan to have presentations mostly in the mornings and group discussions and hand-on sessions in the afternoons. 

### Note for participants of GLAMBIE Workshop (28.08.2023 – 30.08.2023)

The second Glacier Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise (<a href="https://glambie.org/">GLAMBIE</a>) workshop will take place also in Edinburgh during the first half of the week. This is a rare opportunity to connect the modelling and remote sensing communities! We have organized a joint session and social event on Wednesday.

### Who can participate ?
Anyone working on glaciological modeling using OGGM,
but also any other global glacier modeler keen on learning more about OGGM! In particular, 
we would like to encourage model users (current and future) as well as model developers to join 
us. The number of participants is limited to approximately 30 due to the housing limitations 
at the University accomodation. Therefore users and developers of OGGM will be given 
priority in case interest exceeds capacity.

### Location
The workshop will be held at the [Edinburgh Climate Change Institute (ECCI)](https://edinburghcentre.org/). ECCI is part of the School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh. Located in the [heart of the city,](https://goo.gl/maps/Edb3ixpE4D745icW8) is a leading centre for research, teaching, policy and practice for climate action. In general, summers in Edinburgh are reasonably warm and pleasant and the city has a lot to offer including one of the most famous summer festivals in the world [The Fringe](https://www.edfringe.com/experience/what-is-the-festival-fringe). 

### Arrival / departure dates
The workshop starts on the 28th August in the morning and ends on the 1st of September in the afternoon. We recommend to arrive on Sunday (beginners) or Monday (all participants) and depart on Friday evening or Saturday morning.

From The Netherlands (NL) there are a regular [ferries](https://www.dfds.com/en) to Newcastle (England), which is only approx. 2hrs by train from Edinburgh. There are also daily trains from London. 

From the Airport there are several bus routes and tram to the city centre ([Princes street](https://goo.gl/maps/2to6fG8Mgj7DtYQk6)), more information on public transport to and from the Airport can be found [here](https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links). Visit the [Lothian buses website](https://www.lothianbuses.com/) for transport information within Edinburgh. 

From the Edinburgh Waverley train station to ECCI there is approx. a 8 min walk distance and the workshop accommodation is also reachable by bus.  

From Princess Street to Pollocks Estate halls you can either walk for 30 min up and down the hills or take a bus, several routes go there from stop PH: 30/33/14 and the closest bus stop to Pollocks Estate halls is [Commonwealth Pool](https://goo.gl/maps/FL43XJbmpiLzMUz16).

From Pollock Estate halls to ECCI there is approx. a 21 min walk via Arthur’s seat or you can take a bus to the city centre.
