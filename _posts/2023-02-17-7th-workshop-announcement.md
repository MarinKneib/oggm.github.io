### What is it ?

**The workshop is the 7<sup>th</sup> in a series that has brought together the community of users 
and developers of the Open Global Glacier Model ([OGGM](oggm.org)). This year's workshop 
is organized by colleagues based at The University of Edinburgh. It is open to anybody interested in global glacier modeling with focus on active developers and users of OGGM. The primary goal is to discuss the challenges 
and solutions in modeling glaciers at large scales with OGGM, to learn from each other, and to develop 
ideas and visions for the advancement of the model. The workshop will include scientific 
presentations, hands-on coding sessions, discussion/brainstorming sessions, and generally 
be held in an informal manner (with a possible hike to a Scotish National park).**

### Agenda

The workshop will include:

1. <b>Scientific presentations</b> by the participants (ca. 15-20 min) on topics related to the theme of the workshop. 
These can include the state, recent developments and results of glacier modeling with OGGM.
2. <b>Discussion/brainstorming sessions</b> focused on topics of interest, such as future developments and visions for the model.
3. <b>Hands-on sessions</b> in smaller groups including:
    - Beginner tutorials: these sessions are for current and future OGGM users to learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
    - Advanced tutorials: on topics such as <i>How to contribute to OGGM</i>, <i>use OGGM with your own data</i>, or <i>use parts of OGGM with another model</i>.
    - Q&A session: on model problems and possible solutions.
4.  <b>Workshop excursion</b>: Ice sheets covered all of Scotland in the past, leaving an amazing landscape behind. We plan to have a one-day excursion to one of Scotland's iconic ice carved landscapes.

We like to keep the schedule flexible in order to meet the needs, interests and suggestions 
of the participants. Tentatively, we plan to have presentations mostly in the mornings and 
group discussions and hand-on sessions in the afternoons. 

### Who can participate ?
Anyone working on glaciological modeling using OGGM,
but also any other global glacier modeler keen on learning more about OGGM! In particular, 
we would like to encourage model users (current and future) as well as model developers to join 
us. The number of participants is limited to approximately 30 due to the housing limitations 
at the University accomodation. Therefore users and developers of OGGM will be given 
priority in case interest exceeds capacity.

### Location
The workshop will be held at the [Edinburgh Climate Change Institute (ECCI)](https://edinburghcentre.org/). ECCI is part of the School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh. Located in the [heart of the city,](https://goo.gl/maps/Edb3ixpE4D745icW8) is a leading centre for research, teaching, policy and practice for climate action. In general, summers in Edinburgh are reasonably warm and pleasant and the city has a lot to offer including one of the most famouse summer festivals in the world [The Fringe](https://www.edfringe.com/experience/what-is-the-festival-fringe). 

### Transportation
Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland (in the UK) therefore, it is very accesible by flight or train. Edinburgh Airport is the closest international airport and Edinburgh Waverley is the name of the central train station. From Amsterdam (NL) there are a regular ferries to Newcastle (England), which is only approx. 2hrs by train from Edinburgh. There are also daily trains from London. 

From the Airport there are several bus routes and tram to the city centre ([Princes street](https://goo.gl/maps/2to6fG8Mgj7DtYQk6)), more information on public transport to and from the Airport can be found [here](https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links). Visit the [Lothian buses website](https://www.lothianbuses.com/) for transport information within Edinburgh. 

From the Edinburgh Waverley train station to ECCI there is approx. a 8 min walk distance. And the workshop accommodation is reachable by bus.


### Arrival / departure dates
The workshop starts on the 28th September in the morning and ends on the 1st of September in the afternoon. ??

### Accommodation / meals
All participants will be housed at the [Pollock Estate halls](https://www.uoecollection.com/summer-stays-at-the-university-of-edinburgh/), located at the foot of Arthur's Seat – the city's iconic ancient volcano. There are single and twin occupancy room options. Accommodation in the Estate includes a full Scottish breakfast. Coffe/Tea sessions and Lunches will be provided via The University of Edinburgh catering bussiness at ECCI. Additionally we will host (one or two?) workshop evening dinners.

### Workshop fee
The final workshop fee is not confirmed yet, we anticipate approx. £480 for a shared room option and £620 for a single room option. This will include breakfast, workshop fee, excursion and the conference social dinner. 

### Packing list
<b>Workshop necessities</b>
- Laptop for the hands-on sessions (the wifi connection goes through eduroam)
- If needed, travel adapter for [power outlet](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/united-kingdom-2/)
- Name tag (e.g. from a previous conference)
- Hiking boots

<b>Covid protocol</b>

<b>Workshop excursion</b>

We will have an excursion to the [Grey Mares Tail National Park](https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/grey-mares-tail). The waterfall there is one of the UK’s highest, plunges 60m down into the Moffat Water Valley. This dramatic upland landscape was created by glacial erosion over millions of years and unfolds further up steep slopes past the waterfall to the picturesque Loch Skeen. For the excursion, please bring:
- Hiking boots
- Suitable clothing
- Rain pans 
- Waterproof jacket 
- Hat
- Snacks/Food.
- Small backpack
- Water bottle or thermos. 
- Sunglasses or sunscreen (in case the Scotish weather is kind)
- Make sure you have appropriate health insurance.

<b> Drinks and food </b>

- Breakfast, Coffe/Tea breaks and Lunch will be provided and are included in the fee of the workshop. 
- We will have at least one social dinner also included in the workshop fee. (And probably a second social activity in the middle of the week)
- Note that we will not provide all Dinner meals for the whole week but we will point out good spots to find dinner near the University accommodation and ECCI.
- As Scotland's capital city, Edinburgh is full of food options as is known for its unique and wonderful nightlife. Please check out the [Visiting Edinburgh](https://edinburgh.org/) page so you can make the most of your stay in the city.

### COVID protocol
**I guess we need to decide on this as it does not seem to be much of an issue? At least in the UK all rules have been relax**

Recent covid outbreaks at conferences and workshops have shown how disruptive it can be, 
with many people being sick and stuck abroad. This is something we really want to prevent. 
Even more because the research station is both remote (with no medical facilities in its 
surroundings) and will close right after our stay. Taking this in consideration, combined with 
that we will be living close together, we have decided on the following protocol:

- Everybody needs to bring at least 5 covid rapid-tests. Everybody should take a test 
the day of or the night before boarding the train to Finse. If you test positive, you 
should not travel to Finse. We also request testing the following couple of days.
- Everybody brings sufficient masks (FFP2/N95 or similar, no cloth masks). Wearing masks 
will be optional first, but will become necessary if someone tests positive. 
- If anybody tests positive for covid, the person will need to isolate and can no longer 
participate in the workshop in person. We may adjust the testing protocol as appropriate.

We hope that you agree with this protocol, which aims at everyone’s safety. 
Please get in touch with us if you have any questions!

### Registration
