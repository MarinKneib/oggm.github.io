The OGGM Slack is our platform for all communication related to OGGM
and its various related projects. We aim for this forum to be an inclusive 
and friendly environment, that is more personal than
an open forum where everyone can read and write.

But what is it about? 

We use Slack to get support, to chat amongst other glacier fans, 
and to stay updated about what happens in the community. With topics 
ranging from _how to solve this error in my code_ and 
_has someone done this already_ to 
_who is going to this meeting/conference and would like to get a coffee_
and plenty more... In short, slack can contribute 
to a sense of being part of the community.

### Practicalities

#### Finding your way on the different channels

Slack uses "channels", which are chat groups dedicated to selected topics. 
Everyone is in the `#general` channel, that is used sparingly for general
announcements useful to everyone. The`#general` channel is also 
where the invitations to our fortnightly meetings are announced. The 
`#support` channel is often the best place to ask questions, and 
`#random` is being used for chitchat, from pet pictures to nerdy jokes.

When asking a question in the `#support` channel, it will (hopefully) 
be answered in the thread bellow. A "thread" is a discussion originating 
from a post. Once your question has been 
answered, it would be great if you could add a check mark 
to the main question, using e.g. the ✅ emoji (you will see what I mean when 
scrolling through the support channel), so that the others 
know the question has been answered and won't loose time reading 
the whole thread when offering their help.

Aside from those channels that most people follow, there are 
many thematic channels that one can join based on interest. 
`#tidewater`, `#surface-mass-balance`, 
`#hardcore-programming` and `#oggm-edu` are some examples . 

Aside from the channels, slack can also be used to chat privately to one or more people 
at the same time. You can chat or "huddle", which is like a phone call with or without 
camera.  

#### Meeting online

Everyone on our slack is very welcome to join the 
once-every-two-weeks-meetings, no matter your background or 
plans with OGGM. It is quite an informal meeting, so no reason to 
be nervous about joining it. Having said that, it might be more 
interesting to those actively planning to use/using and develop the 
model, than those who don’t. Either way, being new to the community 
it might be nice to join the meeting once, so you will be able to 
meet some of the active members, and you will no longer be "just a 
name" for them. For the schedule you can checkout the 
[calendar](https://oggm.org/meetings/).

### How to join?

Slack can be accessed through the browser and via a local 
installation. My personal preference is using the app, and I 
think that is the case for most frequent users.

If you’re interested in joining the OGGM Slack, please send an 
e-mail to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org), stating shortly 
who you are and why you would like to join our slack.
