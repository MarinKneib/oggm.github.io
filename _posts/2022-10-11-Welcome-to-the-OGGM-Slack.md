The OGGM Slack is our platform for internal communication. 
Though internal sounds maybe like a closed, small, and secretive 
group. It is not. It is an open, inclusive and friendly environment, 
that is a little more closed than an open forum where everyone 
can read what you wrote and a lot less anonymous. But what is it about? 
We use the slack to get support, discuss and stay updated. With topics 
ranging from <i>how to solve this error in my code</i> and <i>has 
someone done this already</i> to <i>who is going to this meeting/conference</i>
and plenty more... In addition the slack can contribute 
to a sense of being part of the community.

### A little more on the practicalities of our slack.

<b>Finding your way on the different channels</b>

In this workspace we have a <i>#general</i> channel, that we use not 
surprisingly for general messages. The <i>#general</i> channel is also 
where the call for our fortnightly meetings are announced. The 
<i>#support</i> channel is often the best place to ask questions and 
<i>#random</i> is being used for chitchat.
When asking a question in the <i>#support</i> channel it will (hopefully) 
be answered in the threat bellow. Once your question has been 
answered it would be great if you can add a check mark 
to the main question, using e.g. the ✅ emoji (you will see what I mean when 
scrolling through the support channel), so that the others 
know the question has been answered and won't loose time reading 
the whole threat when offering their help.
Aside from those channels that most people follow, there are 
many thematic channels that one can add themselves to based on 
there interest when being a full member (people with a guest status, 
have to ask for that). To name a few <i>#surface-mass-balance</i>, 
<i>#hard-core-programming</i> and <i>#oggm-edu</i>. Aside from the channels, 
slack can also be used to chat privately to one or more people 
at the same time. You can do that in 3 ways: the standard typing, 
video-call and huddle. The latter one is more like a phone call.  

<b>Meeting online</b>

Everyone on our slack is very welcome to join the 
once-every-two-weekly-meetings, no matter your background or 
plans with OGGM. It is quite an informal meeting, so no reason to 
be nervous about joining it. Having said that, it might be more 
interesting to those actively planning to use/using and develop the 
model, than those who don’t. Either way being new to the community 
it might be nice to join the meeting once, so you will be able to 
meet some of the active members, and you will no longer be “just a 
name” for them. The starting time alternates currently between 
starting at 10:00 and 17:00 CEST/CET, to accommodate for different 
time zones and schedules. (The next meeting is on October 19th 
10:00-11:00 CEST.) For the schedule you can checkout the 
[calendar](https://oggm.org/meetings/).

<b>How to access?</b>

Slack can be accessed through the browser and via a local 
installation. My personal preference is using the app, and I 
think that is the case for most frequent users. When using slack 
in a browser, you need to keep in mind that only Chrome supports 
the video calls. 

If you’re interested in joining the OGGM Slack, please send an 
e-mail to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org), stating shortly 
who you are and why you would like to join our slack.
