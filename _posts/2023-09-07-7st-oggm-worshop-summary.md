Last week was already the 7<sup>th</sup> OGGM workshop, this time hosted Edinburgh Climate Change 
Institute (ECCI), which is a part of the University of Edinburgh. 
Though over the years some of the workshop structure has become somewhat established, there 
were quite some new elements this year. One of these was the joined session with the Glacier 
Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise (GLAMBIE), who coincidentally organized their workshop 
at the same time and city as ours. This gave us the opportunity to meet up with those focusing 
on mass balance measurements on a global scale and their stakeholders. First we met during a 
joined session and later in the evening at a Ceilidh, a Scottish gathering with a band and 
traditional dances. The band guided us nicely through the steps of each dance. Soon everyone 
was circling and swirling through the room. 

Like in previous years the workshop program consisted of a general introduction, hands-on 
sessions with OGGM tutorials, discussions on a range of topics and themed sessions with 
scientific presentations. This years themes were: “Insights in global glacier modelling”, 
“Glacier evolution, past and future, ensemble studies and intercomparison”, “Accumulation 
and ablation processes”, “Glacier Data”, “Modelling, data assimilation and machine 
learning” and “Future research plans”. The discussions partly followed the themes of the 
presentations session and partly addressed other topics like “Future governance of OGGM” 
and “Coupling OGGM with a GCM”. During the later session, we discussed the added value of 
coupling a glacier model to a GCM and the obstacles one will likely encounter. The 
precipitation correction factor used in glacier modeling and the energy conservation that 
is essential for GCMs, were two of the hurdles that came up. We ended the workshop with a 
lovely hike at the Grey Mare’s tail Nature Reserve, an area were there are still signs of 
past glacier erosion. 

We thank everyone involved, and specially Beatriz Recinos and Dan Goldberg, for making this 
workshop a success. We’re already looking forward to the next edition. Lets see where that will be…
